2025-08-21 14:59:56 [DEBUG] src.summarizer: Raw news: President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on a top policymaker at the Federal Reserve to resign, after one of his allies alleged that she committed mortgage fraud.

In a letter dated August 15, Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte urged the Justice Department to investigate a pair of mortgages taken out in recent years by Fed Governor Lisa Cook.

On Wednesday, Trump referenced those allegations on his social media platform, writing that “Cook must resign, now!!!”

But Cook pushed back on calls to resign, saying she would not be pushed out of the Fed.


“I learned from the media that FHFA Director William Pulte posted on social media that he was making a criminal referral based on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve,” Cook wrote in a statement.

“I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet. I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,” she added.

Pulte, a vocal Trump ally, has frequently criticized the Fed and its leader, Chair Jerome Powell, for not lowering rates. He also called for closer scrutiny of the central bank’s costly refurbishment of its Washington, DC, headquarters.

“She needs to explain herself, but it’s all there in black and white,” Pulte said in a phone interview with CNBC on Wednesday. “I think she needs to resign quickly.”


The new focus on Cook is an expansion of the Trump administration’s intense pressure campaign against the Fed, specifically central bankers who aren’t perceived as allies of the president.

Trump is still loudly demanding the Fed lower interest rates, continuing to bash Powell with the moniker “Too Late.” After raising rates in recent years to fight pandemic inflation that reached 40-year highs in 2022, the central bank started to cut its benchmark lending rate last fall. While inflation earlier this year hovered close to the bank’s target rate of 2%, central bankers have paused further rate cuts while they ascertain the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs.

In the letter, which Pulte posted on social media, he alleged that Cook, a Biden appointee, “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute.”


Pulte refers to a mortgage Cook took out in June 2021 to purchase a property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which stipulated it would be her primary home address for at least a year, according to the letter. Cook then took out another mortgage in Georgia two weeks later, Pulte said, also declaring that property as her primary home address. Cook’s Georgia home was later listed as a rental, according to Pulte.

The housing official has functioned as a reliable attack dog for the Trump administration, routinely taking to social media to berate Powell, essentially around the clock. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has criticized Pulte’s incessant use of social media for political attacks.

But Pulte told CNBC that his call for Cook to resign was apolitical.

“There can be no mortgage fraud. This came across our desk, and it’s my duty to report it,” Pulte said. “It wouldn’t matter if she were a Republican or a Democrat. It is what it is.”


The Fed declined CNN’s request for comment.

As Cook faces pressure, the Senate Banking Committee is expected to soon consider Trump’s nomination of Stephen Miran, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill the vacancy on the central bank’s board left by Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee.

Why Trump’s Fed nominee may get the cold shoulder at the central bank

“We see a window for the Senate to confirm Stephen Miran as a Fed governor, but question if Lisa Cook has an incentive to resign before the meeting. Either way, we see limited impact as the (Fed’s rate-setting committee’s) membership is broader than just Federal Reserve Board members,” Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in commentary issued Wednesday.


“For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next (Fed) meeting,” he said.

If Cook were to resign from the Fed’s board, that would leave only two governors appointed solely by a Democratic president out of a total of seven seats: Fed Governor Michael Barr and Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. Kugler stepped down from her governor position earlier this month. Powell has been appointed to Fed roles by Democratic and Republican presidents, and his term as chair ends in May 2026, though his position as a governor stretches to 2028.

Cook is the first Black woman appointed to the Fed’s Board of Governors.

The Trump administration’s latest attacks come as Fed policymakers convene in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for an annual economics symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, seen as a major event for the world’s central bankers and US monetary policy.


During his keynote speech at the conference, Powell is widely expected to signal long-awaited rate cuts in the second half of the year, citing fragility in the labor market, which is the theme of the symposium. Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 83% chance of a rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting, according to futures.

Since Trump began his second term, Powell has resisted the president’s demands to lower rates and has mostly refrained from responding to his personal attacks. Trump recently backed off from his threats to fire Powell, though it would have led to an uphill battle in the courts if he were to try.

“It looks to me like the administration is admitting they can’t push Powell out or push him around,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. “Moreover, they realize that even when they appoint his successor, there is no guarantee they achieve their preferred policy outcome.”

“They are going to need to create the conditions where they can replace enough members to get the votes they want,” he added.

While inflation earlier this year hovered close to the bank’s target rate of 2%, central bankers have paused further rate cuts while they ascertain the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs.

In the letter, which Pulte posted on social media, he alleged that Cook, a Biden appointee, “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute.”


Pulte refers to a mortgage Cook took out in June 2021 to purchase a property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which stipulated it would be her primary home address for at least a year, according to the letter. Cook then took out another mortgage in Georgia two weeks later, Pulte said, also declaring that property as her primary home address. Cook’s Georgia home was later listed as a rental, according to Pulte.

The housing official has functioned as a reliable attack dog for the Trump administration, routinely taking to social media to berate Powell, essentially around the clock. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has criticized Pulte’s incessant use of social media for political attacks.

But Pulte told CNBC that his call for Cook to resign was apolitical.

“There can be no mortgage fraud. This came across our desk, and it’s my duty to report it,” Pulte said. “It wouldn’t matter if she were a Republican or a Democrat. It is what it is.”


The Fed declined CNN’s request for comment.

As Cook faces pressure, the Senate Banking Committee is expected to soon consider Trump’s nomination of Stephen Miran, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill the vacancy on the central bank’s board left by Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee.

Why Trump’s Fed nominee may get the cold shoulder at the central bank

“We see a window for the Senate to confirm Stephen Miran as a Fed governor, but question if Lisa Cook has an incentive to resign before the meeting. Either way, we see limited impact as the (Fed’s rate-setting committee’s) membership is broader than just Federal Reserve Board members,” Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in commentary issued Wednesday.


“For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next (Fed) meeting,” he said.

If Cook were to resign from the Fed’s board, that would leave only two governors appointed solely by a Democratic president out of a total of seven seats: Fed Governor Michael Barr and Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. Kugler stepped down from her governor position earlier this month. Powell has been appointed to Fed roles by Democratic and Republican presidents, and his term as chair ends in May 2026, though his position as a governor stretches to 2028.

Cook is the first Black woman appointed to the Fed’s Board of Governors.

The Trump administration’s latest attacks come as Fed policymakers convene in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for an annual economics symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, seen as a major event for the world’s central bankers and US monetary policy.


During his keynote speech at the conference, Powell is widely expected to signal long-awaited rate cuts in the second half of the year, citing fragility in the labor market, which is the theme of the symposium. Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 83% chance of a rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting, according to futures.

Since Trump began his second term, Powell has resisted the president’s demands to lower rates and has mostly refrained from responding to his personal attacks. Trump recently backed off from his threats to fire Powell, though it would have led to an uphill battle in the courts if he were to try.

“It looks to me like the administration is admitting they can’t push Powell out or push him around,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. “Moreover, they realize that even when they appoint his successor, there is no guarantee they achieve their preferred policy outcome.”

“They are going to need to create the conditions where they can replace enough members to get the votes they want,” he added.

2025-08-21 16:25:18 [DEBUG] src.summarizer: Raw news: The U.S. stock market is hovering at record highs, but economists such as Bob Elliott
        (Unlimited Funds) and Tiffany Wilding (PIMCO) warn that under the surface, weaknesses are growing.
        Consumer spending is slowing, job growth is weakening, and reduced immigration is creating
        structural imbalances hidden by market optimism. The minutes of the Fed’s July meeting revealed
        concerns about tariffs and cooling demand. While investors still expect rate cuts, confidence is
        fragile. The bond market shows weaker dynamics compared to equities. The S&P 500 gained 3.1% in
        the quarter and 8.7% year-to-date, but largely thanks to a few mega-cap tech stocks, raising fears
        of “structural fragility.” Wilding stresses that current policy may only deepen the disconnect
        between financial markets and the real economy. Analysts note the eerie parallels with the early
        2000s tech bubble and the mid-2000s housing bubble, where confidence in growth masked deepening
        weaknesses. This time, the concern is that AI-led investments create both extraordinary
        concentration risk and dependency on fragile narratives about productivity that are not yet
        supported by broad-based data. If the narrow rally falters, spillover effects could cascade into
        credit markets, consumer confidence, and global trade.

**U.S. Stock Market at Record Highs, But Underlying Weaknesses Grow**

YNotCare: The U.S. stock market is at record highs, but economists warn of slowing consumer spending, weakening job growth, and structural imbalances due to reduced immigration. The Fed is concerned about tariffs and cooling demand, while the bond market shows weaker dynamics compared to equities.

- Household: Monitor spending and job security, as economic slowdowns can impact personal finances.

- Inflation & Costs: Expect potential price increases due to tariffs and reduced supply from lower immigration.

- Real Estate: Be cautious with investments, as economic fragility could affect property values.

- Investments/Markets: Diversify portfolios to mitigate risks from a narrow tech-driven rally.

- Career & Education / Policy & Geopolitics: Upskill to adapt to potential job market shifts and policy changes.

        United are, Rashford says, not failing but also not succeeding, trapped in cycles: optimism,
        disappointment, restart, optimism again, disappointment again. He adds, ‘Look at Liverpool:
        stability. Look at City: stability. At United? Churn. Too much churn.’

YNotCare: Manchester United struggles with inconsistent management and strategy, contrasting with Liverpool's stability under Klopp.

- Household: Expect continued underperformance in matches, affecting fan morale and merchandise sales.

- Inflation & Costs: High player turnover and frequent managerial changes may lead to increased spending without guaranteed success.

- Real Estate: No direct impact, but fan discontent could affect local businesses near Old Trafford.

- Investments/Markets: Investors may see volatility in United-related stocks or merchandise due to instability.

- Career & Education / Policy & Geopolitics: Rashford's comments highlight the importance of long-term vision in sports management.

        and highlighting the voracious investor interest in AI. Led by Thrive Capital with backing from
        heavyweights like Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global, GIC, and Insight Partners, the round will

        profitability, Databricks is positioning itself for the long game—far beyond typical
        liquidity-driven IPO timelines. Investors view it as a future platform leader in AI, prioritizing
        scale over speed. Executives argue that the company’s competitive moat is not only its data
        management tools but also its partnerships with the biggest cloud players, enabling deep
        integration into enterprise workloads. Analysts warn, however, that competition from OpenAI,
        Anthropic, and Google DeepMind will require continuous innovation and heavy spending.

2025-08-21 16:46:14 [DEBUG] src.summarizer: Raw news: The U.S. stock market is hovering at record highs, but economists such as Bob Elliott
        (Unlimited Funds) and Tiffany Wilding (PIMCO) warn that under the surface, weaknesses are growing.
        Consumer spending is slowing, job growth is weakening, and reduced immigration is creating
        structural imbalances hidden by market optimism. The minutes of the Fed’s July meeting revealed
        concerns about tariffs and cooling demand. While investors still expect rate cuts, confidence is
        fragile. The bond market shows weaker dynamics compared to equities. The S&P 500 gained 3.1% in
        the quarter and 8.7% year-to-date, but largely thanks to a few mega-cap tech stocks, raising fears
        of “structural fragility.” Wilding stresses that current policy may only deepen the disconnect
        between financial markets and the real economy. Analysts note the eerie parallels with the early
        2000s tech bubble and the mid-2000s housing bubble, where confidence in growth masked deepening
        weaknesses. This time, the concern is that AI-led investments create both extraordinary
        concentration risk and dependency on fragile narratives about productivity that are not yet
        supported by broad-based data. If the narrow rally falters, spillover effects could cascade into
        credit markets, consumer confidence, and global trade.

        relentless carousel of managers and strategies. He contrasts this with Liverpool's transformation
        under Jürgen Klopp, whose vision unified player development from academy to first team. United,

        sometimes managers come and go and change everything—staff, diet, youth system, even medical teams.
        The results? Fifteenth place last season. Cup wins but no stability. Expensive signings—some useful,
        some not—arrive and leave quickly. The stadium is modernized, yet fans chant “no direction.” 
        United are, Rashford says, not failing but also not succeeding, trapped in cycles: optimism,
        disappointment, restart, optimism again, disappointment again. He adds, ‘Look at Liverpool:
        stability. Look at City: stability. At United? Churn. Too much churn.’

        that the disaster may worsen in coming weeks. Monsoon rains exceeded seasonal averages by nearly
        40%, overwhelming riverbanks and destroying vital infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and

2025-08-21 16:57:42 [DEBUG] src.summarizer: Raw news: Marcus Rashford bluntly describes Manchester United as stuck in “no man's land,” citing the
        relentless carousel of managers and strategies. He contrasts this with Liverpool's transformation
        under Jürgen Klopp, whose vision unified player development from academy to first team. United,
        Rashford argues, lacks consistency: sometimes the style is attacking, sometimes it is defensive,
        sometimes managers come and go and change everything—staff, diet, youth system, even medical teams.
        The results? Fifteenth place last season. Cup wins but no stability. Expensive signings—some useful,
        some not—arrive and leave quickly. The stadium is modernized, yet fans chant “no direction.” 
        United are, Rashford says, not failing but also not succeeding, trapped in cycles: optimism,
        disappointment, restart, optimism again, disappointment again. He adds, ‘Look at Liverpool:
        stability. Look at City: stability. At United? Churn. Too much churn.’

- Team impact: Inconsistent management and strategies hinder team cohesion and development, leading to mixed results.
- League implications: United's instability could allow other top clubs to pull further ahead in the Premier League.

        and highlighting the voracious investor interest in AI. Led by Thrive Capital with backing from
        heavyweights like Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global, GIC, and Insight Partners, the round will
        enable stock liquidity for employees, accelerate AI product development, and support acquisitive
        growth. With a $3 billion revenue run rate projected by January and an imminent shift to
        profitability, Databricks is positioning itself for the long game—far beyond typical
        liquidity-driven IPO timelines. Investors view it as a future platform leader in AI, prioritizing
        scale over speed. Executives argue that the company’s competitive moat is not only its data
        management tools but also its partnerships with the biggest cloud players, enabling deep
        integration into enterprise workloads. Analysts warn, however, that competition from OpenAI,
        Anthropic, and Google DeepMind will require continuous innovation and heavy spending.

2025-08-21 16:57:47 [DEBUG] src.summarizer: Raw news: In Washington, lawmakers clash—again—over federal budget priorities. The debate is messy,
        fragmented, filled with contradictions: some call for defense spending increases, others demand
        urgent cuts to balance the deficit, while still others mix these stances in strange ways. One
        senator declared, “We cannot both raise spending and cut taxes, but we must do both, somehow,
        for the people.” This confusing rhetoric echoes across cable news: some experts say the U.S. is
        at risk of a debt spiral, others say the debt is manageable, others dismiss the entire conversation.
        Public reaction is polarized: some fear inflation, some fear unemployment, some fear foreign
        competition. The White House insists compromise is possible but offers no plan. Meanwhile,
        lobbyists push for climate credits, defense contractors push for jets, states push for grants.
        Nothing is clear, nothing is stable. Analysts describe the process as “a fog of words,” and the
        result—gridlock—seems inevitable. Observers note the eerie similarity to the 2011 debt ceiling
        standoff, but this time with even less clarity, more talking points, less listening.

**U.S. Stock Market Hits Record Highs Amid Growing Underlying Weaknesses**

YNotCare: The U.S. stock market is at record highs, but economists warn of hidden weaknesses like slowing consumer spending, weakening job growth, and structural imbalances due to reduced immigration. The Fed is concerned about tariffs and cooling demand, while the bond market shows weaker dynamics compared to equities. The S&P 500's gains are largely driven by a few mega-cap tech stocks, raising fears of "structural fragility" and parallels to past bubbles.
- Household: Monitor spending and adjust budgets as consumer confidence may falter.
- Inflation & Costs: Expect potential price increases due to tariffs and cooling demand.
- Real Estate: Be cautious of potential market corrections due to structural imbalances.
- Investments/Markets: Diversify portfolios to mitigate risks from mega-cap tech stocks and consider hedging strategies.
- Career & Education / Policy & Geopolitics: Stay informed about potential policy changes and their impact on the job market and global trade.

2025-08-21 16:59:01 [DEBUG] src.summarizer: Raw news: Marcus Rashford bluntly describes Manchester United as stuck in “no man's land,” citing the
        relentless carousel of managers and strategies. He contrasts this with Liverpool's transformation
        under Jürgen Klopp, whose vision unified player development from academy to first team. United,
        Rashford argues, lacks consistency: sometimes the style is attacking, sometimes it is defensive,
        sometimes managers come and go and change everything—staff, diet, youth system, even medical teams.
        The results? Fifteenth place last season. Cup wins but no stability. Expensive signings—some useful,
        some not—arrive and leave quickly. The stadium is modernized, yet fans chant “no direction.” 
        United are, Rashford says, not failing but also not succeeding, trapped in cycles: optimism,
        disappointment, restart, optimism again, disappointment again. He adds, ‘Look at Liverpool:
        stability. Look at City: stability. At United? Churn. Too much churn.’

        and highlighting the voracious investor interest in AI. Led by Thrive Capital with backing from
        heavyweights like Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global, GIC, and Insight Partners, the round will
        enable stock liquidity for employees, accelerate AI product development, and support acquisitive
        growth. With a $3 billion revenue run rate projected by January and an imminent shift to
        profitability, Databricks is positioning itself for the long game—far beyond typical
        liquidity-driven IPO timelines. Investors view it as a future platform leader in AI, prioritizing
        scale over speed. Executives argue that the company’s competitive moat is not only its data
        management tools but also its partnerships with the biggest cloud players, enabling deep
        integration into enterprise workloads. Analysts warn, however, that competition from OpenAI,
        Anthropic, and Google DeepMind will require continuous innovation and heavy spending.

2025-08-21 16:59:06 [DEBUG] src.summarizer: Raw news: In Washington, lawmakers clash—again—over federal budget priorities. The debate is messy,
        fragmented, filled with contradictions: some call for defense spending increases, others demand
        urgent cuts to balance the deficit, while still others mix these stances in strange ways. One
        senator declared, “We cannot both raise spending and cut taxes, but we must do both, somehow,
        for the people.” This confusing rhetoric echoes across cable news: some experts say the U.S. is
        at risk of a debt spiral, others say the debt is manageable, others dismiss the entire conversation.
        Public reaction is polarized: some fear inflation, some fear unemployment, some fear foreign
        competition. The White House insists compromise is possible but offers no plan. Meanwhile,
        lobbyists push for climate credits, defense contractors push for jets, states push for grants.
        Nothing is clear, nothing is stable. Analysts describe the process as “a fog of words,” and the
        result—gridlock—seems inevitable. Observers note the eerie similarity to the 2011 debt ceiling
        standoff, but this time with even less clarity, more talking points, less listening.

        Rice paddies and fisheries, critical to the livelihoods of millions, face long-term collapse.
        International aid has been slow to mobilize, in part due to strained global supply chains and
        competing crises in other regions. Climate scientists argue that such extreme weather events are
        increasingly linked to global warming and rising sea levels, warning that South Asia is among the
        most vulnerable areas in the world. Aid organizations stress the need for coordinated relief:
        shelter, medicine, food, and long-term resilience planning. The government pledges assistance but
        faces criticism for weak infrastructure spending and lack of preparedness.

Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

The latest defeat leaves Burnley with three points from four games after throwing away two potential draws.</p> <p>“It’s really heartbreaking the way the game finishes for us,” manager Scott Parker said. “Two weeks in a row that it’s in the dying minutes, two penalties that decide the games. And we don’t manage to get the result.</p> <p>“It’s pretty disappointing. I thought the players really produced a performance. It was everything we’ve worked on. I’m just gutted for them.”</p>

Stars read Michael Rosen’s 2014 poem Don’t Mention the Children in film released by Save the Children

<p>Guy Pearce, Annie Lennox and Vanessa Redgrave are among the celebrities calling for an end to the “normalised horror” of children being killed in Gaza, as part of new short film.</p> 
<p>Released by Save the Children and Choose Love, it features the stars reciting the words to a poem by Michael Rosen. Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/israel-bans-radio-advert-listing-names-children-killed-gaza">a Guardian article</a> about the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:</p> 
<p><em>Don’t mention the children.<strong><br></strong>Don’t name the dead children.<strong><br></strong>The people must not know the names<strong><br></strong>of the dead children.</em></p> 
<p>“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.</p> 
<p>“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.<em>”</em></p> 
<p>Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.</p> 
<p>The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>They are urging the public to sign a <a href="https://act.savethechildren.org.uk/a/gaza-petition-labour-gov-july?_gl=1*1wjmj1b*_gcl_au*MTE1NjI5OTk0Ni4xNzU1MDg2MDg1*_ga*NDgxMDI4Nzk4LjE3MzAzMDUyOTQ.*_ga_GXWTYMDL9D*czE3NTY4Mjc4MjQkbzE3OSRnMCR0MTc1NjgyNzgyNCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">petition</a> demanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.</p> 
<p>“We have all seen the devastating images of children in Gaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”</p> 
<p>He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”</p> 
<p>At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.</p> 
<p>“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.</p> 
<p>Save the Children has been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.</p> 
<p>Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.</p> 
<p>“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”</p>

**Far-right AfD triples support in key German state election**

YNotCare: Germany's far-right AfD party has significantly increased its support in North Rhine-Westphalia, securing 16.5% of the vote. This is more than triple its 2020 result, indicating a shift in German politics.
- Political landscape: Mainstream parties may struggle to maintain their "firewall" policy against collaborating with the AfD as it gains local political positions.

2025-09-14 22:16:24 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Manchester United will keep my style, insists Amorim, despite heavy derby defeat

Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:16:26 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Fans defy rain and defeat as Everton Women begin new era at Goodison Park

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

Stars read Michael Rosen’s 2014 poem Don’t Mention the Children in film released by Save the Children

<p>Guy Pearce, Annie Lennox and Vanessa Redgrave are among the celebrities calling for an end to the “normalised horror” of children being killed in Gaza, as part of new short film.</p> 
<p>Released by Save the Children and Choose Love, it features the stars reciting the words to a poem by Michael Rosen. Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/israel-bans-radio-advert-listing-names-children-killed-gaza">a Guardian article</a> about the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:</p> 
<p><em>Don’t mention the children.<strong><br></strong>Don’t name the dead children.<strong><br></strong>The people must not know the names<strong><br></strong>of the dead children.</em></p> 
<p>“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.</p> 
<p>“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.<em>”</em></p> 
<p>Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.</p> 
<p>The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>They are urging the public to sign a <a href="https://act.savethechildren.org.uk/a/gaza-petition-labour-gov-july?_gl=1*1wjmj1b*_gcl_au*MTE1NjI5OTk0Ni4xNzU1MDg2MDg1*_ga*NDgxMDI4Nzk4LjE3MzAzMDUyOTQ.*_ga_GXWTYMDL9D*czE3NTY4Mjc4MjQkbzE3OSRnMCR0MTc1NjgyNzgyNCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">petition</a> demanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.</p> 
<p>“We have all seen the devastating images of children in Gaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”</p> 
<p>He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”</p> 
<p>At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.</p> 
<p>“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.</p> 
<p>Save the Children has been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.</p> 
<p>Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.</p> 
<p>“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:21:06 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Far-right AfD’s vote triples in elections in German bellwether state

Party takes 16.5% of the vote in North Rhine-Westphalia, behind governing CDU and Social Democrats

<p>Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has more than tripled its support in local elections in the country’s most populous state, a poll seen as Friedrich Merz’s first significant electoral test since he took office as chancellor four months ago.</p> <p>According to exit poll results from North Rhine-Westphalia, Merz’s Christian Democrats won with 34% – about the equivalent of its historically worst result in the same poll in 2020 – while the AfD secured 16.5%.</p> <p>North Rhine-Westphalia, home to almost a quarter of Germany’s citizens and made up of swathes of agricultural land, post-industrial towns and cities with large multi-ethnic and student populations, is viewed as something of a bellwether for the country as a whole.</p> <p>Almost 14 million people were eligible to vote, equivalent to the size of some EU countries, and larger than the electorate of all east German states, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/01/success-far-right-afd-shows-east-west-germany-drifting-further-apart">where the AfD is strongest</a>. The vote determines 20,000 seats in the councils of more than 320 towns, cities and municipalities as well as the positions of mayors and lord mayors across the state. Voter turnover was 59%, up from 2020.</p> <p>Merz’s conservative CDU fulfilled predictions that it would retain its dominant position in the state. The Social Democrats, its junior coalition partner in the federal government, came in second with 22.5%, a small drop from its result in 2020 that defied pollsters’ predictions that it was facing heavy losses.<strong> </strong>The SPD has struggled to retain support in some areas, in particular former coalmining regions where it was once sure of victory.</p> <p>The AfD’s strong showing lived up to pollsters’ predictions, more than tripling its standing from five years ago when it secured 5.1%, and giving its candidates who are running for mayoral positions a considerable chance of reaching second-round votes in two weeks’ time. </p> <p>The AfD’s gains appear to have been made on the back of heavy losses for the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic party. The far-left Die Linke secured 5.5%, putting it above its 2020 result of 3.8%.</p>    <p>Political observers say the vote indicates the AfD is on track to repeat the big gains it has made in the states of the former communist east, where it has been most successful at drawing on voters’ disgruntlement with the status quo. It has set as its goal to enter the federal government by 2027. Currently it is the largest opposition party in parliament. </p> <p>The vote took place against the backdrop of a weakened German economy, rising unemployment and growing unease over immigration – the AfD’s key issue. Merz has pledged to get the economy back on track, reduce immigration and cut the far right down to size.</p> <p>Since February’s federal election, the AfD has come top in several national opinion polls. The more success the AfD achieves in securing a foothold in local political positions, by securing mayoralties and councillor posts, the harder it will be for the mainstream parties to uphold their pledge to maintain a “firewall” preventing political collaboration with the AfD at the federal level, experts say.</p> <p>International issues also played a role in the North Rhine-Westphalia campaign, even if they only indirectly affect local political issues, with Merz seen as a bolder figure in representing Germany’s interests abroad than his Social Democrat predecessor, Olaf Scholz.</p> <p>Particular attention has been given to the role he has forged in trying to bring European allies together over the defence of Ukraine as the Trump administration vacillates over its backing. But on immigration, where he has pledged to dramatically change Germany’s policy, voters have said they are not so convinced, despite the fact that numbers have dropped in recent months.</p> <p>The AfD has presented itself as a confident alternative, scoring points with voters on issues such as energy provision, education and above all immigration, even though these policy areas are not decided at the local level.</p>

Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:21:09 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Fans defy rain and defeat as Everton Women begin new era at Goodison Park

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

2025-09-14 22:21:10 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Isak needs time to get fit says Slot after leaving striker out of Liverpool win at Burnley

Liverpool manager Arne Slot insisted he would be patient with his new £125m striker Alexander Isak after he missed pre-season

<p>Arne Slot says Liverpool need to be patient with Alexander Isak after leaving him out of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">1-0 victory against Burnley</a>. The striker is not ready for the demands of playing regularly after missing pre-season and Slot is looking to build up his stamina slowly.</p> <p>Mohamed Salah settled the match in the 95th minute from the penalty spot after Hannibal Mejbri handballed inside the box on a day that Liverpool’s talismanic forward misfired.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Mohamed Salah on the spot as Liverpool break Burnley hearts in stoppage time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We got him from Newcastle in a state where you could say his pre-season is going to start now,” Slot said. “He needs proper minutes of training before he has a certain base, let alone for him to play twice in three days.</p> <p>“So that’s what we do, we try to prepare players for the beginning of the season once a week, and then we try to do more and more and more before we go into the rhythm of two games a week, so that they are ready for that schedule.”</p> <p>The Liverpool defender Milos Kerkez was replaced before half-time after being booked for a dive inside the Burnley box. “The only way we could lose this game, if we go down to 10, because with 11 v 11, we could have drawn it, but we couldn’t have lost it because they’ve never been over the halfway line, let alone in our own 18-yard box,” Slot said.</p> <p>“I didn’t want to take that risk, which was hard for Milos because normally you don’t have to take a player off if he has a yellow before.”</p>    <p>Burnley endured the same fate last time out when an injury-time Jaidon Anthony foul allowed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/30/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report">Manchester United to win 3-2 at Old Trafford</a>. The latest defeat leaves Burnley with three points from four games after throwing away two potential draws.</p> <p>“It’s really heartbreaking the way the game finishes for us,” manager Scott Parker said. “Two weeks in a row that it’s in the dying minutes, two penalties that decide the games. And we don’t manage to get the result.</p> <p>“It’s pretty disappointing. I thought the players really produced a performance. It was everything we’ve worked on. I’m just gutted for them.”</p>

Party takes 16.5% of the vote in North Rhine-Westphalia, behind governing CDU and Social Democrats

<p>Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has more than tripled its support in local elections in the country’s most populous state, a poll seen as Friedrich Merz’s first significant electoral test since he took office as chancellor four months ago.</p> <p>According to exit poll results from North Rhine-Westphalia, Merz’s Christian Democrats won with 34% – about the equivalent of its historically worst result in the same poll in 2020 – while the AfD secured 16.5%.</p> <p>North Rhine-Westphalia, home to almost a quarter of Germany’s citizens and made up of swathes of agricultural land, post-industrial towns and cities with large multi-ethnic and student populations, is viewed as something of a bellwether for the country as a whole.</p> <p>Almost 14 million people were eligible to vote, equivalent to the size of some EU countries, and larger than the electorate of all east German states, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/01/success-far-right-afd-shows-east-west-germany-drifting-further-apart">where the AfD is strongest</a>. The vote determines 20,000 seats in the councils of more than 320 towns, cities and municipalities as well as the positions of mayors and lord mayors across the state. Voter turnover was 59%, up from 2020.</p> <p>Merz’s conservative CDU fulfilled predictions that it would retain its dominant position in the state. The Social Democrats, its junior coalition partner in the federal government, came in second with 22.5%, a small drop from its result in 2020 that defied pollsters’ predictions that it was facing heavy losses.<strong> </strong>The SPD has struggled to retain support in some areas, in particular former coalmining regions where it was once sure of victory.</p> <p>The AfD’s strong showing lived up to pollsters’ predictions, more than tripling its standing from five years ago when it secured 5.1%, and giving its candidates who are running for mayoral positions a considerable chance of reaching second-round votes in two weeks’ time. </p> <p>The AfD’s gains appear to have been made on the back of heavy losses for the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic party. The far-left Die Linke secured 5.5%, putting it above its 2020 result of 3.8%.</p>    <p>Political observers say the vote indicates the AfD is on track to repeat the big gains it has made in the states of the former communist east, where it has been most successful at drawing on voters’ disgruntlement with the status quo. It has set as its goal to enter the federal government by 2027. Currently it is the largest opposition party in parliament. </p> <p>The vote took place against the backdrop of a weakened German economy, rising unemployment and growing unease over immigration – the AfD’s key issue. Merz has pledged to get the economy back on track, reduce immigration and cut the far right down to size.</p> <p>Since February’s federal election, the AfD has come top in several national opinion polls. The more success the AfD achieves in securing a foothold in local political positions, by securing mayoralties and councillor posts, the harder it will be for the mainstream parties to uphold their pledge to maintain a “firewall” preventing political collaboration with the AfD at the federal level, experts say.</p> <p>International issues also played a role in the North Rhine-Westphalia campaign, even if they only indirectly affect local political issues, with Merz seen as a bolder figure in representing Germany’s interests abroad than his Social Democrat predecessor, Olaf Scholz.</p> <p>Particular attention has been given to the role he has forged in trying to bring European allies together over the defence of Ukraine as the Trump administration vacillates over its backing. But on immigration, where he has pledged to dramatically change Germany’s policy, voters have said they are not so convinced, despite the fact that numbers have dropped in recent months.</p> <p>The AfD has presented itself as a confident alternative, scoring points with voters on issues such as energy provision, education and above all immigration, even though these policy areas are not decided at the local level.</p>

Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:28:23 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Fans defy rain and defeat as Everton Women begin new era at Goodison Park

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

Stars read Michael Rosen’s 2014 poem Don’t Mention the Children in film released by Save the Children

<p>Guy Pearce, Annie Lennox and Vanessa Redgrave are among the celebrities calling for an end to the “normalised horror” of children being killed in Gaza, as part of new short film.</p> 
<p>Released by Save the Children and Choose Love, it features the stars reciting the words to a poem by Michael Rosen. Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/israel-bans-radio-advert-listing-names-children-killed-gaza">a Guardian article</a> about the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:</p> 
<p><em>Don’t mention the children.<strong><br></strong>Don’t name the dead children.<strong><br></strong>The people must not know the names<strong><br></strong>of the dead children.</em></p> 
<p>“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.</p> 
<p>“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.<em>”</em></p> 
<p>Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.</p> 
<p>The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>They are urging the public to sign a <a href="https://act.savethechildren.org.uk/a/gaza-petition-labour-gov-july?_gl=1*1wjmj1b*_gcl_au*MTE1NjI5OTk0Ni4xNzU1MDg2MDg1*_ga*NDgxMDI4Nzk4LjE3MzAzMDUyOTQ.*_ga_GXWTYMDL9D*czE3NTY4Mjc4MjQkbzE3OSRnMCR0MTc1NjgyNzgyNCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">petition</a> demanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.</p> 
<p>“We have all seen the devastating images of children in Gaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”</p> 
<p>He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”</p> 
<p>At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.</p> 
<p>“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.</p> 
<p>Save the Children has been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.</p> 
<p>Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.</p> 
<p>“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:32:34 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Far-right AfD’s vote triples in elections in German bellwether state

Party takes 16.5% of the vote in North Rhine-Westphalia, behind governing CDU and Social Democrats

<p>Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has more than tripled its support in local elections in the country’s most populous state, a poll seen as Friedrich Merz’s first significant electoral test since he took office as chancellor four months ago.</p> <p>According to exit poll results from North Rhine-Westphalia, Merz’s Christian Democrats won with 34% – about the equivalent of its historically worst result in the same poll in 2020 – while the AfD secured 16.5%.</p> <p>North Rhine-Westphalia, home to almost a quarter of Germany’s citizens and made up of swathes of agricultural land, post-industrial towns and cities with large multi-ethnic and student populations, is viewed as something of a bellwether for the country as a whole.</p> <p>Almost 14 million people were eligible to vote, equivalent to the size of some EU countries, and larger than the electorate of all east German states, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/01/success-far-right-afd-shows-east-west-germany-drifting-further-apart">where the AfD is strongest</a>. The vote determines 20,000 seats in the councils of more than 320 towns, cities and municipalities as well as the positions of mayors and lord mayors across the state. Voter turnover was 59%, up from 2020.</p> <p>Merz’s conservative CDU fulfilled predictions that it would retain its dominant position in the state. The Social Democrats, its junior coalition partner in the federal government, came in second with 22.5%, a small drop from its result in 2020 that defied pollsters’ predictions that it was facing heavy losses.<strong> </strong>The SPD has struggled to retain support in some areas, in particular former coalmining regions where it was once sure of victory.</p> <p>The AfD’s strong showing lived up to pollsters’ predictions, more than tripling its standing from five years ago when it secured 5.1%, and giving its candidates who are running for mayoral positions a considerable chance of reaching second-round votes in two weeks’ time. </p> <p>The AfD’s gains appear to have been made on the back of heavy losses for the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic party. The far-left Die Linke secured 5.5%, putting it above its 2020 result of 3.8%.</p>    <p>Political observers say the vote indicates the AfD is on track to repeat the big gains it has made in the states of the former communist east, where it has been most successful at drawing on voters’ disgruntlement with the status quo. It has set as its goal to enter the federal government by 2027. Currently it is the largest opposition party in parliament. </p> <p>The vote took place against the backdrop of a weakened German economy, rising unemployment and growing unease over immigration – the AfD’s key issue. Merz has pledged to get the economy back on track, reduce immigration and cut the far right down to size.</p> <p>Since February’s federal election, the AfD has come top in several national opinion polls. The more success the AfD achieves in securing a foothold in local political positions, by securing mayoralties and councillor posts, the harder it will be for the mainstream parties to uphold their pledge to maintain a “firewall” preventing political collaboration with the AfD at the federal level, experts say.</p> <p>International issues also played a role in the North Rhine-Westphalia campaign, even if they only indirectly affect local political issues, with Merz seen as a bolder figure in representing Germany’s interests abroad than his Social Democrat predecessor, Olaf Scholz.</p> <p>Particular attention has been given to the role he has forged in trying to bring European allies together over the defence of Ukraine as the Trump administration vacillates over its backing. But on immigration, where he has pledged to dramatically change Germany’s policy, voters have said they are not so convinced, despite the fact that numbers have dropped in recent months.</p> <p>The AfD has presented itself as a confident alternative, scoring points with voters on issues such as energy provision, education and above all immigration, even though these policy areas are not decided at the local level.</p>

Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:32:37 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Fans defy rain and defeat as Everton Women begin new era at Goodison Park

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

2025-09-14 22:32:42 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Guy Pearce and Annie Lennox join call to end ‘normalised horror’ for children in Gaza

Stars read Michael Rosen’s 2014 poem Don’t Mention the Children in film released by Save the Children

<p>Guy Pearce, Annie Lennox and Vanessa Redgrave are among the celebrities calling for an end to the “normalised horror” of children being killed in Gaza, as part of new short film.</p> 
<p>Released by Save the Children and Choose Love, it features the stars reciting the words to a poem by Michael Rosen. Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/israel-bans-radio-advert-listing-names-children-killed-gaza">a Guardian article</a> about the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:</p> 
<p><em>Don’t mention the children.<strong><br></strong>Don’t name the dead children.<strong><br></strong>The people must not know the names<strong><br></strong>of the dead children.</em></p> 
<p>“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.</p> 
<p>“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.<em>”</em></p> 
<p>Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.</p> 
<p>The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>They are urging the public to sign a <a href="https://act.savethechildren.org.uk/a/gaza-petition-labour-gov-july?_gl=1*1wjmj1b*_gcl_au*MTE1NjI5OTk0Ni4xNzU1MDg2MDg1*_ga*NDgxMDI4Nzk4LjE3MzAzMDUyOTQ.*_ga_GXWTYMDL9D*czE3NTY4Mjc4MjQkbzE3OSRnMCR0MTc1NjgyNzgyNCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">petition</a> demanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.</p> 
<p>“We have all seen the devastating images of children in Gaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”</p> 
<p>He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”</p> 
<p>At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.</p> 
<p>“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.</p> 
<p>Save the Children has been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.</p> 
<p>Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.</p> 
<p>“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”</p>

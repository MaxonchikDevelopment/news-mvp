Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

The latest defeat leaves Burnley with three points from four games after throwing away two potential draws.</p> <p>“It’s really heartbreaking the way the game finishes for us,” manager Scott Parker said. “Two weeks in a row that it’s in the dying minutes, two penalties that decide the games. And we don’t manage to get the result.</p> <p>“It’s pretty disappointing. I thought the players really produced a performance. It was everything we’ve worked on. I’m just gutted for them.”</p>

Stars read Michael Rosen’s 2014 poem Don’t Mention the Children in film released by Save the Children

<p>Guy Pearce, Annie Lennox and Vanessa Redgrave are among the celebrities calling for an end to the “normalised horror” of children being killed in Gaza, as part of new short film.</p> 
<p>Released by Save the Children and Choose Love, it features the stars reciting the words to a poem by Michael Rosen. Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/israel-bans-radio-advert-listing-names-children-killed-gaza">a Guardian article</a> about the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:</p> 
<p><em>Don’t mention the children.<strong><br></strong>Don’t name the dead children.<strong><br></strong>The people must not know the names<strong><br></strong>of the dead children.</em></p> 
<p>“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.</p> 
<p>“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.<em>”</em></p> 
<p>Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.</p> 
<p>The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>They are urging the public to sign a <a href="https://act.savethechildren.org.uk/a/gaza-petition-labour-gov-july?_gl=1*1wjmj1b*_gcl_au*MTE1NjI5OTk0Ni4xNzU1MDg2MDg1*_ga*NDgxMDI4Nzk4LjE3MzAzMDUyOTQ.*_ga_GXWTYMDL9D*czE3NTY4Mjc4MjQkbzE3OSRnMCR0MTc1NjgyNzgyNCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">petition</a> demanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.</p> 
<p>“We have all seen the devastating images of children in Gaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”</p> 
<p>He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”</p> 
<p>At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.</p> 
<p>“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.</p> 
<p>Save the Children has been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.</p> 
<p>Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.</p> 
<p>“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”</p>

**Far-right AfD triples support in key German state election**

YNotCare: Germany's far-right AfD party has significantly increased its support in North Rhine-Westphalia, securing 16.5% of the vote. This is more than triple its 2020 result, indicating a shift in German politics.
- Political landscape: Mainstream parties may struggle to maintain their "firewall" policy against collaborating with the AfD as it gains local political positions.

2025-09-14 22:16:24 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Manchester United will keep my style, insists Amorim, despite heavy derby defeat

Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:16:26 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Fans defy rain and defeat as Everton Women begin new era at Goodison Park

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

Stars read Michael Rosen’s 2014 poem Don’t Mention the Children in film released by Save the Children

<p>Guy Pearce, Annie Lennox and Vanessa Redgrave are among the celebrities calling for an end to the “normalised horror” of children being killed in Gaza, as part of new short film.</p> 
<p>Released by Save the Children and Choose Love, it features the stars reciting the words to a poem by Michael Rosen. Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/israel-bans-radio-advert-listing-names-children-killed-gaza">a Guardian article</a> about the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:</p> 
<p><em>Don’t mention the children.<strong><br></strong>Don’t name the dead children.<strong><br></strong>The people must not know the names<strong><br></strong>of the dead children.</em></p> 
<p>“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.</p> 
<p>“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.<em>”</em></p> 
<p>Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.</p> 
<p>The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>They are urging the public to sign a <a href="https://act.savethechildren.org.uk/a/gaza-petition-labour-gov-july?_gl=1*1wjmj1b*_gcl_au*MTE1NjI5OTk0Ni4xNzU1MDg2MDg1*_ga*NDgxMDI4Nzk4LjE3MzAzMDUyOTQ.*_ga_GXWTYMDL9D*czE3NTY4Mjc4MjQkbzE3OSRnMCR0MTc1NjgyNzgyNCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">petition</a> demanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.</p> 
<p>“We have all seen the devastating images of children in Gaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”</p> 
<p>He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”</p> 
<p>At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.</p> 
<p>“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.</p> 
<p>Save the Children has been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.</p> 
<p>Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.</p> 
<p>“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:21:06 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Far-right AfD’s vote triples in elections in German bellwether state

Party takes 16.5% of the vote in North Rhine-Westphalia, behind governing CDU and Social Democrats

<p>Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has more than tripled its support in local elections in the country’s most populous state, a poll seen as Friedrich Merz’s first significant electoral test since he took office as chancellor four months ago.</p> <p>According to exit poll results from North Rhine-Westphalia, Merz’s Christian Democrats won with 34% – about the equivalent of its historically worst result in the same poll in 2020 – while the AfD secured 16.5%.</p> <p>North Rhine-Westphalia, home to almost a quarter of Germany’s citizens and made up of swathes of agricultural land, post-industrial towns and cities with large multi-ethnic and student populations, is viewed as something of a bellwether for the country as a whole.</p> <p>Almost 14 million people were eligible to vote, equivalent to the size of some EU countries, and larger than the electorate of all east German states, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/01/success-far-right-afd-shows-east-west-germany-drifting-further-apart">where the AfD is strongest</a>. The vote determines 20,000 seats in the councils of more than 320 towns, cities and municipalities as well as the positions of mayors and lord mayors across the state. Voter turnover was 59%, up from 2020.</p> <p>Merz’s conservative CDU fulfilled predictions that it would retain its dominant position in the state. The Social Democrats, its junior coalition partner in the federal government, came in second with 22.5%, a small drop from its result in 2020 that defied pollsters’ predictions that it was facing heavy losses.<strong> </strong>The SPD has struggled to retain support in some areas, in particular former coalmining regions where it was once sure of victory.</p> <p>The AfD’s strong showing lived up to pollsters’ predictions, more than tripling its standing from five years ago when it secured 5.1%, and giving its candidates who are running for mayoral positions a considerable chance of reaching second-round votes in two weeks’ time. </p> <p>The AfD’s gains appear to have been made on the back of heavy losses for the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic party. The far-left Die Linke secured 5.5%, putting it above its 2020 result of 3.8%.</p>    <p>Political observers say the vote indicates the AfD is on track to repeat the big gains it has made in the states of the former communist east, where it has been most successful at drawing on voters’ disgruntlement with the status quo. It has set as its goal to enter the federal government by 2027. Currently it is the largest opposition party in parliament. </p> <p>The vote took place against the backdrop of a weakened German economy, rising unemployment and growing unease over immigration – the AfD’s key issue. Merz has pledged to get the economy back on track, reduce immigration and cut the far right down to size.</p> <p>Since February’s federal election, the AfD has come top in several national opinion polls. The more success the AfD achieves in securing a foothold in local political positions, by securing mayoralties and councillor posts, the harder it will be for the mainstream parties to uphold their pledge to maintain a “firewall” preventing political collaboration with the AfD at the federal level, experts say.</p> <p>International issues also played a role in the North Rhine-Westphalia campaign, even if they only indirectly affect local political issues, with Merz seen as a bolder figure in representing Germany’s interests abroad than his Social Democrat predecessor, Olaf Scholz.</p> <p>Particular attention has been given to the role he has forged in trying to bring European allies together over the defence of Ukraine as the Trump administration vacillates over its backing. But on immigration, where he has pledged to dramatically change Germany’s policy, voters have said they are not so convinced, despite the fact that numbers have dropped in recent months.</p> <p>The AfD has presented itself as a confident alternative, scoring points with voters on issues such as energy provision, education and above all immigration, even though these policy areas are not decided at the local level.</p>

Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:21:09 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Fans defy rain and defeat as Everton Women begin new era at Goodison Park

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

2025-09-14 22:21:10 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Isak needs time to get fit says Slot after leaving striker out of Liverpool win at Burnley

Liverpool manager Arne Slot insisted he would be patient with his new £125m striker Alexander Isak after he missed pre-season

<p>Arne Slot says Liverpool need to be patient with Alexander Isak after leaving him out of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">1-0 victory against Burnley</a>. The striker is not ready for the demands of playing regularly after missing pre-season and Slot is looking to build up his stamina slowly.</p> <p>Mohamed Salah settled the match in the 95th minute from the penalty spot after Hannibal Mejbri handballed inside the box on a day that Liverpool’s talismanic forward misfired.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Mohamed Salah on the spot as Liverpool break Burnley hearts in stoppage time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We got him from Newcastle in a state where you could say his pre-season is going to start now,” Slot said. “He needs proper minutes of training before he has a certain base, let alone for him to play twice in three days.</p> <p>“So that’s what we do, we try to prepare players for the beginning of the season once a week, and then we try to do more and more and more before we go into the rhythm of two games a week, so that they are ready for that schedule.”</p> <p>The Liverpool defender Milos Kerkez was replaced before half-time after being booked for a dive inside the Burnley box. “The only way we could lose this game, if we go down to 10, because with 11 v 11, we could have drawn it, but we couldn’t have lost it because they’ve never been over the halfway line, let alone in our own 18-yard box,” Slot said.</p> <p>“I didn’t want to take that risk, which was hard for Milos because normally you don’t have to take a player off if he has a yellow before.”</p>    <p>Burnley endured the same fate last time out when an injury-time Jaidon Anthony foul allowed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/30/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report">Manchester United to win 3-2 at Old Trafford</a>. The latest defeat leaves Burnley with three points from four games after throwing away two potential draws.</p> <p>“It’s really heartbreaking the way the game finishes for us,” manager Scott Parker said. “Two weeks in a row that it’s in the dying minutes, two penalties that decide the games. And we don’t manage to get the result.</p> <p>“It’s pretty disappointing. I thought the players really produced a performance. It was everything we’ve worked on. I’m just gutted for them.”</p>

Party takes 16.5% of the vote in North Rhine-Westphalia, behind governing CDU and Social Democrats

<p>Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has more than tripled its support in local elections in the country’s most populous state, a poll seen as Friedrich Merz’s first significant electoral test since he took office as chancellor four months ago.</p> <p>According to exit poll results from North Rhine-Westphalia, Merz’s Christian Democrats won with 34% – about the equivalent of its historically worst result in the same poll in 2020 – while the AfD secured 16.5%.</p> <p>North Rhine-Westphalia, home to almost a quarter of Germany’s citizens and made up of swathes of agricultural land, post-industrial towns and cities with large multi-ethnic and student populations, is viewed as something of a bellwether for the country as a whole.</p> <p>Almost 14 million people were eligible to vote, equivalent to the size of some EU countries, and larger than the electorate of all east German states, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/01/success-far-right-afd-shows-east-west-germany-drifting-further-apart">where the AfD is strongest</a>. The vote determines 20,000 seats in the councils of more than 320 towns, cities and municipalities as well as the positions of mayors and lord mayors across the state. Voter turnover was 59%, up from 2020.</p> <p>Merz’s conservative CDU fulfilled predictions that it would retain its dominant position in the state. The Social Democrats, its junior coalition partner in the federal government, came in second with 22.5%, a small drop from its result in 2020 that defied pollsters’ predictions that it was facing heavy losses.<strong> </strong>The SPD has struggled to retain support in some areas, in particular former coalmining regions where it was once sure of victory.</p> <p>The AfD’s strong showing lived up to pollsters’ predictions, more than tripling its standing from five years ago when it secured 5.1%, and giving its candidates who are running for mayoral positions a considerable chance of reaching second-round votes in two weeks’ time. </p> <p>The AfD’s gains appear to have been made on the back of heavy losses for the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic party. The far-left Die Linke secured 5.5%, putting it above its 2020 result of 3.8%.</p>    <p>Political observers say the vote indicates the AfD is on track to repeat the big gains it has made in the states of the former communist east, where it has been most successful at drawing on voters’ disgruntlement with the status quo. It has set as its goal to enter the federal government by 2027. Currently it is the largest opposition party in parliament. </p> <p>The vote took place against the backdrop of a weakened German economy, rising unemployment and growing unease over immigration – the AfD’s key issue. Merz has pledged to get the economy back on track, reduce immigration and cut the far right down to size.</p> <p>Since February’s federal election, the AfD has come top in several national opinion polls. The more success the AfD achieves in securing a foothold in local political positions, by securing mayoralties and councillor posts, the harder it will be for the mainstream parties to uphold their pledge to maintain a “firewall” preventing political collaboration with the AfD at the federal level, experts say.</p> <p>International issues also played a role in the North Rhine-Westphalia campaign, even if they only indirectly affect local political issues, with Merz seen as a bolder figure in representing Germany’s interests abroad than his Social Democrat predecessor, Olaf Scholz.</p> <p>Particular attention has been given to the role he has forged in trying to bring European allies together over the defence of Ukraine as the Trump administration vacillates over its backing. But on immigration, where he has pledged to dramatically change Germany’s policy, voters have said they are not so convinced, despite the fact that numbers have dropped in recent months.</p> <p>The AfD has presented itself as a confident alternative, scoring points with voters on issues such as energy provision, education and above all immigration, even though these policy areas are not decided at the local level.</p>

Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:28:23 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Fans defy rain and defeat as Everton Women begin new era at Goodison Park

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

Stars read Michael Rosen’s 2014 poem Don’t Mention the Children in film released by Save the Children

<p>Guy Pearce, Annie Lennox and Vanessa Redgrave are among the celebrities calling for an end to the “normalised horror” of children being killed in Gaza, as part of new short film.</p> 
<p>Released by Save the Children and Choose Love, it features the stars reciting the words to a poem by Michael Rosen. Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/israel-bans-radio-advert-listing-names-children-killed-gaza">a Guardian article</a> about the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:</p> 
<p><em>Don’t mention the children.<strong><br></strong>Don’t name the dead children.<strong><br></strong>The people must not know the names<strong><br></strong>of the dead children.</em></p> 
<p>“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.</p> 
<p>“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.<em>”</em></p> 
<p>Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.</p> 
<p>The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>They are urging the public to sign a <a href="https://act.savethechildren.org.uk/a/gaza-petition-labour-gov-july?_gl=1*1wjmj1b*_gcl_au*MTE1NjI5OTk0Ni4xNzU1MDg2MDg1*_ga*NDgxMDI4Nzk4LjE3MzAzMDUyOTQ.*_ga_GXWTYMDL9D*czE3NTY4Mjc4MjQkbzE3OSRnMCR0MTc1NjgyNzgyNCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">petition</a> demanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.</p> 
<p>“We have all seen the devastating images of children in Gaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”</p> 
<p>He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”</p> 
<p>At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.</p> 
<p>“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.</p> 
<p>Save the Children has been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.</p> 
<p>Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.</p> 
<p>“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:32:34 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Far-right AfD’s vote triples in elections in German bellwether state

Party takes 16.5% of the vote in North Rhine-Westphalia, behind governing CDU and Social Democrats

<p>Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has more than tripled its support in local elections in the country’s most populous state, a poll seen as Friedrich Merz’s first significant electoral test since he took office as chancellor four months ago.</p> <p>According to exit poll results from North Rhine-Westphalia, Merz’s Christian Democrats won with 34% – about the equivalent of its historically worst result in the same poll in 2020 – while the AfD secured 16.5%.</p> <p>North Rhine-Westphalia, home to almost a quarter of Germany’s citizens and made up of swathes of agricultural land, post-industrial towns and cities with large multi-ethnic and student populations, is viewed as something of a bellwether for the country as a whole.</p> <p>Almost 14 million people were eligible to vote, equivalent to the size of some EU countries, and larger than the electorate of all east German states, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/01/success-far-right-afd-shows-east-west-germany-drifting-further-apart">where the AfD is strongest</a>. The vote determines 20,000 seats in the councils of more than 320 towns, cities and municipalities as well as the positions of mayors and lord mayors across the state. Voter turnover was 59%, up from 2020.</p> <p>Merz’s conservative CDU fulfilled predictions that it would retain its dominant position in the state. The Social Democrats, its junior coalition partner in the federal government, came in second with 22.5%, a small drop from its result in 2020 that defied pollsters’ predictions that it was facing heavy losses.<strong> </strong>The SPD has struggled to retain support in some areas, in particular former coalmining regions where it was once sure of victory.</p> <p>The AfD’s strong showing lived up to pollsters’ predictions, more than tripling its standing from five years ago when it secured 5.1%, and giving its candidates who are running for mayoral positions a considerable chance of reaching second-round votes in two weeks’ time. </p> <p>The AfD’s gains appear to have been made on the back of heavy losses for the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic party. The far-left Die Linke secured 5.5%, putting it above its 2020 result of 3.8%.</p>    <p>Political observers say the vote indicates the AfD is on track to repeat the big gains it has made in the states of the former communist east, where it has been most successful at drawing on voters’ disgruntlement with the status quo. It has set as its goal to enter the federal government by 2027. Currently it is the largest opposition party in parliament. </p> <p>The vote took place against the backdrop of a weakened German economy, rising unemployment and growing unease over immigration – the AfD’s key issue. Merz has pledged to get the economy back on track, reduce immigration and cut the far right down to size.</p> <p>Since February’s federal election, the AfD has come top in several national opinion polls. The more success the AfD achieves in securing a foothold in local political positions, by securing mayoralties and councillor posts, the harder it will be for the mainstream parties to uphold their pledge to maintain a “firewall” preventing political collaboration with the AfD at the federal level, experts say.</p> <p>International issues also played a role in the North Rhine-Westphalia campaign, even if they only indirectly affect local political issues, with Merz seen as a bolder figure in representing Germany’s interests abroad than his Social Democrat predecessor, Olaf Scholz.</p> <p>Particular attention has been given to the role he has forged in trying to bring European allies together over the defence of Ukraine as the Trump administration vacillates over its backing. But on immigration, where he has pledged to dramatically change Germany’s policy, voters have said they are not so convinced, despite the fact that numbers have dropped in recent months.</p> <p>The AfD has presented itself as a confident alternative, scoring points with voters on issues such as energy provision, education and above all immigration, even though these policy areas are not decided at the local level.</p>

Ruben Amorim vowed Manchester United would keep playing his way after a chastening derby defeat at Manchester City

<p>A defensive Ruben Amorim insisted after Manchester United’s 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City that his system will remain, so “you have to change the man” if his 3-4-3 formation is to be discarded. The head coach also suggested recent events behind closed doors have hampered the team.</p> <p>City <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">defeated United 3‑0 </a>with Phil Foden’s 18th-minute header and Erling Haaland’s strikes on 53 and 68 minutes. It leaves Amorim’s side on four points after four games and his overall record as 31 from 31 matches.</p> <p>Amorim denied the team’s shape may be adjusted to try to improve results and he pointed to unknown occurrences as a factor in the form. “It is not a record you should have at Manchester United,” he said. “You have no idea what happened [privately] during these [past] months but I accept that. I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.</p> <p>“We talk about this every game that we lose. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. I see that we are doing better but the results don’t show that.</p> <p>I remember last year I played with my former club [Sporting Lisbon] against City [in the Champions League] – we won 4-1. It was not near the same amount of opportunities – the way we controlled that game compared to today. In certain moments we were not better than City – I understand that. It is hard and the record says everything. I understand.”</p> <p>Amorim was asked what the message is to any fans losing faith in him. “That I am going to give everything,” the 40-year-old said. “I will do everything – always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.”</p> <p>Pep Guardiola praised Haaland, who has six goals in four City games. “Erling never disappoints us,” the manager said. “He is a special player.”</p>

2025-09-14 22:32:37 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Fans defy rain and defeat as Everton Women begin new era at Goodison Park

Everton Women were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham in their first WSL match since making Goodison Park their permanent home

<p>As a new era began at Goodison Park, any Everton women’s fans hoping to see a great goal join the long list of iconic strikes scored across 133 years of this famous ground’s history were indeed provided with a memorable one. The problem for the home side was that it was scored by a Tottenham player.</p> <p>When Cathinka Tandberg spotted Courtney Brosnan off her line, as she received the ball 35 yards out, she did not hesitate to attempt the lob, and she would spoil the party for Everton in their first competitive match since making Goodison Park their permanent home. Her first-time strike dropped perfectly and capped an impressive away performance for Spurs, who made it two wins out of two so far under their new head coach, Martin Ho.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/wsl-roundup-chelsea-aston-villa-manchester-united-london-city-leicester-liverpool">Sam Kerr scores after 634-day absence while Manchester United maul Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ambitious effort, four minutes into the second half, came after Olga Ahtinen slotted Spurs in front 27 minutes into a first half they controlled, with Everton unable to click into gear. Ahtinen’s opener came after she won the ball on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Tandberg and slotted low past Brosnan.</p> <p>Both goals came from Tottenham pressing with intensity, as Bethany England tackled Rion Ishikawa before laying the ball off for Tandberg’s long-range lob, on the Norway striker’s first start since her deadline-day move from the Swedish side Hammarby.</p> <p>“She did it in training this week,” Ho said of Tandberg. “The courage to do that and the risk-taking to do that is big and that’s what she’s built on. Overall, her performance was brilliant.”</p>    <p>The former England striker Ellen White labelled the strike “absolutely ridiculous” on the BBC’s live television coverage and Tandberg told the broadcaster: “I did it in my last club. You just have to go for it, and when you score that, it’s unbelievable. When I get those moments I have to do what I like and that’s scoring goals, so ‘go for it’.”</p> <p>It was also a second consecutive clean sheet for Tottenham, whereas for Everton the result brought them back down to earth somewhat, after their positive victory away at Anfield. This game was still historic for them, though. They were backed by 6,473 at Goodison, an attendance which is nearly three times the maximum capacity of their former home at Walton Hall Park.</p> <p>In the stands there were some signs of “the grand old lady” having been vacated recently by the Everton men’s team, not least the many hundreds of seats that have been removed, but in general the venue looked smart. The rebrand around the exterior has been impressive; a timeline of the history of the women’s team is now found proudly along Goodison Road, while along Walton Road, a series of new banners display the “Everton Women” name and say: “A history we own; a future we are making.” Another reads: “Goodison Park, the home of Everton Women.”</p> <p>Despite heavy pre-match rain, the atmosphere was encouraging and the home fans, backed by a drummer, sang old classics such as Spirit of the Blues. “The club has done a magnificent job,” the Everton manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “It looks like our home and it looks good, so I’m happy for women’s football in this part of England, that we have a platform like this. Of course, we want to do better. I don’t know if it was the occasion. But it’s on me to make sure they’re 100% ready, and they weren’t.”</p> <p>Ho, formerly a player at Everton’s boys’ academy before working as assistant coach of Everton Women between 2015 and 2018, labelled the stadium “beautiful”. “Coming back here was an unbelievable feeling. As soon as you come in here, you do feel intimidated because the stadium is quite enclosed. And that’s one thing I said to the players before the game, was ‘we have to expect it to be a bit hostile’, and I thought the fans were brilliant.”</p> <p>Everton’s best moments featured Ruby Mace having a deflected shot saved and Rosa van Gool curling over, but Spurs had the better chances, with Tandberg sliding wide in the first half, England heading wide in the second and Drew Spence forcing Brosnan into a smart late save. Tottenham are one of four teams with a 100% winning start.</p>

2025-09-14 22:32:42 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: Guy Pearce and Annie Lennox join call to end ‘normalised horror’ for children in Gaza

Stars read Michael Rosen’s 2014 poem Don’t Mention the Children in film released by Save the Children

<p>Guy Pearce, Annie Lennox and Vanessa Redgrave are among the celebrities calling for an end to the “normalised horror” of children being killed in Gaza, as part of new short film.</p> 
<p>Released by Save the Children and Choose Love, it features the stars reciting the words to a poem by Michael Rosen. Titled Don’t Mention the Children, the poem was written in 2014 in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/israel-bans-radio-advert-listing-names-children-killed-gaza">a Guardian article</a> about the Israeli government banning a radio advert naming children killed in Gaza. It begins:</p> 
<p><em>Don’t mention the children.<strong><br></strong>Don’t name the dead children.<strong><br></strong>The people must not know the names<strong><br></strong>of the dead children.</em></p> 
<p>“The first time I read Michael Rosen’s poem, not only was I profoundly moved, I was also in shock,” Pearce told the Guardian.</p> 
<p>“Rosen’s brutal commands stare directly into our soul and force us to confront the cruelty of erasing a child, erasing their name, their memory and their life.<em>”</em></p> 
<p>Others featured include the actors Ambika Mod, Joely Richardson, Juliet Stevenson, Denise Gough, Khalid Abdalla, Zawe Ashton and Indira Varma; as well as the presenters Laura Whitmore and Nadia Sawalha, the model Poppy Delevingne, the emergency doctor Dr Mo Mustafa, the activist Stephen Kapos, and the poem’s creator, Michael Rosen.</p> 
<p>The project is paired with renewed calls by Save the Children and Choose Love for the UK government to “end its complicity in the horrors unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank”<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>They are urging the public to sign a <a href="https://act.savethechildren.org.uk/a/gaza-petition-labour-gov-july?_gl=1*1wjmj1b*_gcl_au*MTE1NjI5OTk0Ni4xNzU1MDg2MDg1*_ga*NDgxMDI4Nzk4LjE3MzAzMDUyOTQ.*_ga_GXWTYMDL9D*czE3NTY4Mjc4MjQkbzE3OSRnMCR0MTc1NjgyNzgyNCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">petition</a> demanding “the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to Israel; all perpetrators to be held to account and an end to Israel’s impunity; and decisive action to be taken to bring Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory to an end”.</p> 
<p>“We have all seen the devastating images of children in Gaza, but with time comes a dangerous desensitisation – people look away, or the suffering is ignored, let alone justified by the perpetrators or those complicit,” Pearce said. “The simplicity of this poem doesn’t allow that escape.”</p> 
<p>He added: “Taking part in this recital was, for me, a matter of conscience. Every day in Gaza, children are being killed, maimed or starved – trapped in a nightmare they did nothing to create. We cannot allow this horror to be normalised. I urge everyone to speak out and to act. Silence is complicity.”</p> 
<p>At least 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to the health authorities in Gaza, though independent surveys suggest the figure is far higher. The photographer and Oscar-nominated director Misan Harriman, who spearheaded the film project, said children in Gaza had “endured a relentless stream of atrocities” for nearly two years.</p> 
<p>“Their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed, the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon. And still, the world does nothing to stop it,” he said.</p> 
<p>Save the Children has been working in Gaza for decades, running primary healthcare centres and providing essential services including screening and treatment for malnutrition. But the aid organisation said it had been unable to get any of its own aid into Gaza since 2 March.</p> 
<p>Rosen said: “I wrote Don’t Mention the Children 11 years ago in response to an attempt to silence the names of children killed in Gaza. It is heartbreaking that the poem is still so relevant today – in fact, the situation for children has only grown worse.</p> 
<p>“Behind every number, every statistic, is a child with a name and a future that has been stolen. We cannot allow them to be erased. To deny their names is to deny their humanity, and we must resist that erasure at every turn.”</p>

Is it that they’re really not sponsoring this time? Or maybe it’s just not updated yet?

For those of us who are PhD students looking for internships, this feels a bit concerning. These conferences are usually where we get to connect with researchers from those companies. If they are not sponsoring or showing up in an official way, what’s the best way for us to still get on their radar?

**Looking for ideas to push quality further**  
One experiment I’m planning is **fusing CLIP visual features into the bottleneck of the U-Net matting/refiner** (no text prompts) to inject semantics for tricky regions like hair, fur, and semi-transparent edges.  
**What else would you try?** Pointers to papers/recipes welcome.

Silicon Valley companies are aggressively marketing their AI systems as capable of cutting grunt work and liberating creativity.</p> <p>The polling appears to reflect workers’ uncertainty about how bosses want AI tools to be used, with many employers not offering clear guidance. There is also fear of stigma among colleagues if workers are seen to rely too heavily on the bots.</p> <p>A separate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01901-x">US study</a> circulated this week found that medical doctors who use AI in decision-making are viewed by their peers as significantly less capable. Ironically, the doctors who took part in the research by Johns Hopkins Carey Business School recognised AI as beneficial for enhancing precision, but took a negative view when others were using it.</p> <p>Gaia Marcus, the director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent AI research body, said the large minority of people who did not talk about AI use with their bosses illustrated the “potential for a large trust gap to emerge between government’s appetite for economy-wide AI adoption and the public sense that AI might not be beneficial to them or to the fabric of society”.</p> <p>“We need more evaluation of the impact of using these tools, not just in the lab but in people’s everyday lives and workflows,” she said. “To my knowledge, we haven’t seen any compelling evidence that the spread of these generative AI tools is significantly increasing productivity yet. Everything we are seeing suggests the need for humans to remain in the driving seat with the tools we use.”</p> <p>A study by the Henley Business School in May found 49% of workers reported there were no formal guidelines for AI use in their workplace and more than a quarter felt their employer did not offer enough support.</p> <p>Prof Keiichi Nakata at the school said people were more comfortable about being transparent in their use of AI than 12 months earlier but “there are still some elements of AI shaming and some stigma associated with AI”.</p> <p>He said: “Psychologically, if you are confident with your work and your expertise you can confidently talk about your engagement with AI, whereas if you feel it might be doing a better job than you are or you feel that you will be judged as not good enough or worse than AI, you might try to hide that or avoid talking about it.”</p> <p>OpenAI’s head of solutions engineering for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Matt Weaver, said: “We’re seeing huge demand from business leaders for company-wide AI rollouts – because they know using AI well isn’t a shortcut, it’s a skill. Leaders see the gains in productivity and knowledge sharing and want to make that available to everyone.”</p>

Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”</p> <p>Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down.

2025-09-14 23:05:35 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: <p>A corporate intelligence company part-owned and formerly run by the prime minister’s business adviser has been paid more than £1m by Thames Water as the utilities firm tries to avoid renationalisation, the Guardian can reveal.</p> 
<p>Hakluyt, which was run by Varun Chandra until his appointment as Keir Starmer’s business adviser last July, has worked with Thames since 2023, providing political and strategic advice.</p> 
<p>That commercial relationship between Thames and Hakluyt has continued since Chandra joined No 10. He is now tasked with finding a private sector solution for Thames and preventing Britain’s biggest and most troubled water company from collapsing into state ownership.</p> 
<p>That presents a potential conflict of interest, as the 40-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/08/varun-chandra-starmer-adviser-proving-vital-link-for-labour-in-us-trade-talks">still owns a multimillion-pound stake in Hakluyt</a> and is entitled to receive dividends from the Mayfair company. A No 10 source said Chandra had no personal involvement with Thames when at Hakluyt and made all the relevant declarations as part of his appointment.</p> 
<p>In the spring Chandra intervened in last-ditch talks to persuade the US private equity group KKR to buy Thames Water, including speaking to KKR’s co-founder Henry Kravis.</p> 
<p>Several politically connected Hakluyt employees have also been advising Thames, including a former speechwriter to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and Rishi Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff.</p> 
<p>The revelation underlines Hakluyt’s reach, as well as the revolving door between business and politics. The company, which was founded by former MI6 officers, claims to have advised almost half of the FTSE 100 and more than three-quarters of the top 20 private equity groups.</p> 
<p>It is understood that Hakluyt has been working closely with Thames’s strategy director, Cathryn Ross, a former chief executive of the water regulator Ofwat, since 2023. Sources said Hakluyt had been paid more than £1m by Thames in that time.</p> 
<p>It was hired to work on Project Samuel, Thames’s attempt to secure private sector capital to recapitalise and restructure, as well as contingency planning for the possibility that the utilities company has to enter the government’s special administration regime (SAR) – a form of temporary nationalisation.</p> 
<p>Hakluyt employees including Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff Will Tanner and Josh Platt, a former private secretary and speechwriter to chancellors Rachel Reeves and Jeremy Hunt, have worked on Thames in recent months, Westminster sources said.</p> 
<p>Sir Oliver Robbins, the Foreign Office permanent undersecretary and former Brexit negotiator, also worked on Thames in 2023 while he was employed at Hakluyt as head of corporate coverage for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p> 
<p>Hakluyt is among a string of advisers that have been paid handsomely to advise Thames in recent years. The Guardian revealed that the water company spent at least £136m on the effort to secure emergency funding during the financial year to March 2025, including with the law firms Linklaters and Akin Gump.</p> 
<p>The Treasury is desperate to avoid Thames collapsing into state hands, and Reeves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/01/rachel-reeves-thames-water-creditors">wrote to creditors of the company in July</a> to say a “market-based solution” was her preference.</p> 
<p>Thames has argued that allowing it to enter SAR and imposing heavy losses on its lenders would have a chilling effect on the appetite for UK infrastructure, and drive up wider funding costs.</p> 
<p>Chandra’s efforts to convince KKR to buy Thames were futile as the private equity group walked away in June, blaming excessive risk and politicisation.</p> 
<p>That left only a rescue attempt by its lenders standing between Thames being renationalised.</p> 
<p>A disparate band of more than 100 creditors are trying to convince the government and Ofwat that they should be allowed to take over the company, which serves more than 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley and has debts of more than £20bn. In return they want <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/07/bidders-demand-thames-water-granted-immunity-over-environmental-crimes">leniency from fines and penalties</a>. They have also proposed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/creditors-set-out-20bn-plan-to-save-thames-water">delivering fewer improvements to Thames’s tired water and sewerage network over the next five years</a> than had been agreed with Ofwat – but charging customers the same.</p> 
<p>Chandra is one of Starmer’s most influential advisers, and has spearheaded its attempts to ingratiate Labour with business and attract foreign capital to the UK.</p>

**Thames Water Pays £1M to Firm Tied to PM's Adviser Amid Renationalization Fears**

YNotCare: Thames Water has paid over £1m to Hakluyt, a corporate intelligence firm with ties to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's business adviser, Varun Chandra, for political and strategic advice to avoid renationalization.
- **Financial Impact:** Thames Water's spending on advisory services, including £136m in the financial year to March 2025, may raise concerns about cost management and efficiency.
- **Regulatory Impact:** Thames Water's attempts to secure private sector capital and avoid state ownership could influence future regulations and oversight by Ofwat and the Treasury.
- **Political Impact:** The involvement of politically connected individuals from Hakluyt in advising Thames Water may raise questions about the revolving door between business and politics.
- **Investor Impact:** Investors and creditors may need to reassess their positions and strategies regarding Thames Water, considering the potential for renationalization and the company's financial situation.
- **Consumer Impact:** Customers may face higher costs or fewer improvements to the water and sewerage network if creditors' proposals are accepted.
2025-09-14 23:05:38 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: <p>Keir Starmer defended Peter Mandelson in the House of Commons two days after details of the damning emails between the former ambassador to the US and Jeffrey Epstein were passed to Downing Street, according to reports.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations">The prime minister sacked Mandelson</a> on Thursday after emails were published revealing that he had told Epstein “your friends stay with you and love you” while the disgraced financier was facing jail for sex offences.</p> <p>The Foreign Office received a media enquiry outlining details of the messages on Tuesday, which was passed to No 10, PA Media and the Times reported.</p> <p>The permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office, Oliver Robbins, allegedly asked Mandelson about the veracity of the emails but did not receive a response until Wednesday afternoon, a government source told PA.</p> <p>The prime minister is understood not to have been aware of the contents of the emails until Wednesday evening. By that time, he had told the Commons he had confidence in Mandelson during prime minister’s questions at midday.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch accused Starmer and Labour MPs of “lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson’s involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein”. <br><br>The Tory leader wrote on X: “If No 10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement. The prime minister has very serious questions to answer. The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when.”</p> <p>Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, the backbench Labour MP Olivia Blake said the reports that Starmer had not been told about Mandelson’s emails to Epstein soon enough were “really embarrassing”. “Any operation that fails to tell a prime minister when something as substantial as those emails are presented to them clearly has deep failings,” she said.</p> <p>“We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the backbenches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> <p>“Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier so that he can get on top of it.”</p> <p>She said Labour should consider whether Mandelson, who had displayed “a lack of judgment”, should continue to represent the party in the Lords. “It’s very worrying that we’re in this position,” she said. </p> <p>The Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs on Thursday that Mandelson had not disclosed the extent of his friendship with Epstein at the time of his appointment.</p> <p>“The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment,” he said. “In particular, Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information.”</p> <p>He said Mandelson was being sacked “with immediate effect” in light of the new information.</p> <p>The Guardian was told Starmer had taken the decision to sack Mandelson during a meeting with Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, on Thursday morning, after reviewing the new material on Mandelson’s defence of Epstein the previous night.</p> <p>It is understood Mandelson had not had access to the emails written in 2008 himself until the leak, because they came from a long-deleted account, which was not available during the Foreign Office’s vetting process for the role of ambassador.</p> <p>His friendship with Epstein was known before his appointment, however, and he is reported to have told the Times that he admitted in his vetting interview that he continued his relationship with the convicted sex offsender for many years.</p> <p>Downing Street said on Friday that Starmer has “confidence in his top team” when asked whether questions had been raised over the judgment of his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was reported to have lobbied for Mandelson’s appointment.</p> <p>The backbencher Clive Lewis publicly questioned Starmer’s leadership, telling the BBC the prime minister does not seem “up to the job”.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, another MP from the party’s backbenches, said “toxic” resentment was festering among the party’s MPs and rank and file members.</p> <p>Lucy Powell, one of two candidates to take Angela Rayner’s place as Labour’s deputy leader, called for a change of culture.</p> <p>“We’ve got a bit of a groupthink happening at the top, that culture of not being receptive to interrogation, not being receptive to differing views,” she said.</p> <p>Downing Street has been contacted for comment.</p>

It’s not safe to let anyone out.”</p> <p>Why the Met had not expected marchers to take over Trafalgar Square was a question on the lips of many of the counter-protesters who were drawn from trade unions and anti-racist groups, and were outnumbered by about 20 to one by those attending the far-right rally.</p> <p>That some of the crowd so quickly turned to violence was unsurprising, as the nationalist flag-waving group were worked up to a lather by racist and Islamophobic speeches.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/13/elon-musk-calls-for-dissolution-of-parliament-at-far-right-rally-in-london">Elon Musk calls for dissolution of parliament at far-right rally in London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yaxley-Lennon himself introduced a survivor of the Rotherham grooming scandal on stage by asking: “How hasn’t there been a revolution already about this rape jihad against our daughters?”</p> <p>Any semblance of “unity” that Yaxley-Lennon claimed to be calling for was shown to be a ludicrous facade when the speakers got talking to the crowd.</p> <p>Éric Zemmour, a French far-right politician, said the “freedom of our peoples is in danger” from a “great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture. You and we are being colonised by our former colonies.”</p> <p>Elon Musk, appearing via video link, told the crowd: “Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.”</p> <p>When violence inevitably erupted, one of Yaxley-Lennon’s supporters could be seen standing on a barricade, using a megaphone in a futile attempt to call for calm after being brought in by police.</p> <p>Fireworks and bottles were lobbed at mounted police and, at one point, an injured Yaxley-Lennon supporter with blood pouring from a head wound was carried through a barrier by police medics and pulled through the crowd of anti-fascists who jeered and shouted: “Nazi scum.”</p>    <p>Though holding a bandage to his head, he still managed to spit at those shouting at him.</p> <p>Within the anti-fascist ranks, moments of joy and levity cut through the gloomy day.</p> <p>Realising they were likely to be trapped for some time, dozens of the counter-protesters exhibited some creative dance moves to an eclectic selection of music belted out from their sound system, which included Kneecap and Diana Ross.</p> <p>One group who had not anticipated being trapped were the Graell family, on holiday from Barcelona. They had been to the National Gallery that morning and chose to go to the Silver Cross pub on Whitehall for lunch, unaware of the events about to unfold.</p> <p>“Then when we wanted to go out, we couldn’t leave,” said Elisenda, adding that it was the first time in London for her parents, Joan Maria and Empar. “It has been interesting.”</p> <p>Over time, the police slowly gained control as a couple of heavy bouts of rain thinned the far-right crowd, who were pushed back enough to make a path for the counter-protesters to escape.</p> <p>By 6.45pm a cleanup operation of the broken glass and empty beer cans had already begun in the area reclaimed by police from the marchers, though a couple of hundred still languished in Trafalgar Square draped in their cold, soggy flags.</p> <p>An Asian employee of a magic-themed souvenir shop, which had locked down during attacks on the police outside, appeared stoic as he washed away vomit from outside the front door with a large bottle of water.</p>

Against this background a scary word last used in the 1970s is being uttered again: stagflation.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/LxXFM/2/" data-alt="GDP chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/LxXFM/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Stagflation is the term that describes “stagnant” growth combined with “inflation” of prices. It means that companies are producing and hiring less, but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs">US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending.</p> <p>For now, the US economy isn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it.</p> <p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">tariffs</a> were announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021.</p> <p>However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/01/jobs-report-july-trump-tariffs-trade-war">revised down</a> by 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation rate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs">hit</a> 2.9%, the highest since January.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/" data-alt="Inflation chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing.</p> <p>“Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.”</p> <p>In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation.</p> <p>Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation.</p> <p>Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention">crackdown on immigration</a> has cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/inflation-cpi-trump-tariffs">prices</a>, tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers.</p> <p>Investors are banking on hopes the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> cutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain.</p> <p>In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole">outlined</a> the “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025">US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”</p> <p>Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down. Inflation went down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August.</p> <p>The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty.</p> <p>“Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.”</p> <p>One <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/trump-goldman-sachs-chief-david-solomon">analysis</a> from Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue.</p> <p>If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/" data-alt="jobs chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said.</p> <p>The Yale Budget Lab <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/effect-tariffs-poverty">estimated</a> that Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”.</p> <p>The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics">claimed</a> that recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president.</p> <p>“The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.”</p>

2025-09-14 23:17:47 [DEBUG] summarizer: Raw news: A chip fab is where we currently manufacture semiconductors.

What I’m really asking is: what do you call the moment in time when a system becomes a fully autonomous replicator? And what do you think will happen politically? In this scenario humans are still in control of the ai.

Imagine an AI system that can:

Operate mining equipment and extract raw materials

Construct a fully functional semiconductor fab (including complex machinery like EUV tools)

Use that fab to create more machines, servers, and computing infrastructure


At that point, such an AI wouldn’t need humans in the loop.

I chose a semiconductor fab as the example because it’s arguably the most technically challenging piece of the replication puzzle.
